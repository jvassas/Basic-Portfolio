                My name is Jacob Vassas and I am a motivated student living in Cleveland Ohio. For my undergraduate degree, I am enrolled at Cleveland State University where my major is Health Science with a minor in Business. My expected graduation date is December 2018. Aside from CSU, I am also enrolled in Case Western Reserve's Coding Bootcamp where I am learning become a Web Developer upon completion of the course, in October 2018.

                My professional experience consists of working in the I.T. field at different levels. In 2018, I began interning at Mercy Regional Hospital in Lorian, Ohio in the Health Informatics department. Coinciding with working at Mercy, I have done work within my family's business, Vassas Telecommunications Consulting (VTC) since 2016. VTC specializes in voice, data audit analysis and voice, data and I.T. consulting.

                When I am not studying or working with information technology, I bartend part time in Downtown Cleveland. My total experience with bartending consists of 3 years and my favorite cocktail is an Old Fashioned. This may seem to be a very hectic schedule but I believe that staying busy is extremely beneficial when striving towards goals. My interests include technology, large cities and urban areas, food, travel, and Cleveland sports teams, the Cavs, Indians and yes, the Browns.
